@workspace Hi Chat. Can you help me to debug the deployment of the two services `productsvc` and `ordersvc` and the frontend? I'll append the output of `helm upgrade --install productsvc infra/helm/productsvc -n app --create-namespace --debug`. Tell me, what you need.


</user>
<assistant>
Quick note / initial finding
- The attached Helm output shows the Productsvc Deployment is using the frontend image: see helm-install-productsvc.log (MANIFEST -> image: "registry.infra.svc.cluster.local/frontend:latest"). That likely explains services failing because the container doesn't run the productsvc binary.
- Relevant files: values.yaml, deployment.yaml, Dockerfile, main.go.  

What I need from you to debug further
- Output of these commands (paste results):
  - helm debug / install outputs for all three charts:
    - helm upgrade --install productsvc infra/helm/productsvc -n app --create-namespace --debug (you already have this; good)
    - helm upgrade --install ordersvc infra/helm/ordersvc -n app --create-namespace --debug
    - helm upgrade --install frontend infra/helm/frontend -n app --create-namespace --debug
  - Kubernetes runtime state:
    - kubectl get pods -n app -o wide
    - kubectl get deployments -n app
    - kubectl describe deployment productsvc -n app
    - kubectl describe deployment ordersvc -n app
    - kubectl describe pod <productsvc-pod-name> -n app
    - kubectl logs <productsvc-pod-name> -n app
    - kubectl describe pod <ordersvc-pod-name> -n app
    - kubectl logs <ordersvc-pod-name> -n app
  - kubectl get events -n app
  - helm get values productsvc -n app
  - helm get manifest productsvc -n app (if possible)
- The debug outputs above will let me confirm image names, args, env, readiness probe failures, CrashLoopBackOff reasons, etc.

Immediate fix suggestion
- Update the productsvc Helm values so the image repository points to the productsvc image (not frontend). Example change (adjust repository to your registry):

````yaml
# ...existing code...
image:
  repository: localhost:5000/productsvc
  tag: latest
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
# ...existing code...
````

Additional checks I will make once you paste the requested outputs
- Confirm the deployed image and container command for productsvc and ordersvc (from manifest + pod spec).
- Inspect container logs / events for startup errors (DB connection, missing binary, port mismatch).
- Verify AUTO_MIGRATE and env vars are set as intended.
- If image is wrong, suggest CI/build/Chart value change and a helm upgrade command to fix.

Next step
- Paste the outputs of the kubectl/helm commands above (or attach the logs). I’ll analyze and give targeted fixes.

I'll create a short todo list and then read the three Helm chart values files to confirm the image settings so I can propose exact fixes (expected outcome: confirm which charts use the wrong image and produce recommended helm/patch actions). I'll locate and read the three Helm charts (productsvc, ordersvc, frontend) so I can confirm which images the charts render and suggest exact edits (outcome: list of files and lines to change). I'll run searches and then read the chart value and deployment templates. I'm going to search the Helm charts for where the frontend image or global image values could be injected (outcome: find any overrides or mistaken references causing `productsvc` to render `frontend:latest`). I'll run a workspace grep and read the Chart.yaml for `productsvc`. I'll search the helm charts for any shared or global image value that could override per-chart `image.repository` (outcome: locate any `global` keys or common templates setting image values). I'll summarize what I inspected, the root causes, and give concrete fixes you can run (pwsh commands) plus validation steps. If you want, I can apply the Helm fixes now — tell me which option you prefer and I’ll run the commands.

## Actions taken
- Read the attached `kubectl`/`helm` outputs you provided and the three Helm chart values.yaml / deployment.yaml files for `productsvc`, `ordersvc`, and frontend.
- Created and used a short todo list and completed the log analysis + fix proposal items.

## Key findings (root causes)
1. ImagePull errors — every service is failing to start because Kubernetes cannot pull the container images:
   - Many pods show ImagePullBackOff or ErrImagePull (see `kubectl get pods -n app` and per-pod `Events`).
   - For frontend pods, the error is DNS resolution for `registry.infra.svc.cluster.local`:
     - failed to resolve reference "registry.infra.svc.cluster.local/frontend:latest": dial tcp: lookup registry.infra.svc.cluster.local: no such host
   - For `ordersvc`/`productsvc` pods, `Back-off pulling image "localhost:5000/…"` appears (the cluster cannot fetch images from `localhost:5000` as referenced).
2. Wrong image in `productsvc` release manifest:
   - The active `productsvc` manifest shows `image: "registry.infra.svc.cluster.local/frontend:latest"` (frontend image). That explains why `productsvc` pods are not running the products service and is likely a values/override error during install/upgrade.
   - The chart template for `productsvc` is correct (uses `.Values.image.repository`), and values.yaml in the repo shows `registry.infra.svc.cluster.local/productsvc`. So the wrong image rendered likely came from an explicit value override during the Helm install/upgrade (or from an earlier release/values mixup).
3. Mixed image names across revisions:
   - Some pods reference `localhost:5000/*` (old RS) and others `registry.infra.svc.cluster.local/*` (new RS). The cluster doesn't have a resolvable registry at those names, so both fail.
4. No application-level errors visible yet — containers never start because images aren't pulled, so no logs from app processes.

Summary: two problems to solve:
- Ensure the container images referenced by Helm are available to the k3d cluster (fix registry availability or import images into k3d).
- Fix the `productsvc` release so its imageRepository/tag actually points at the productsvc image (and remove accidental frontend image reference).

## Recommended fixes — pick one path per point below

### A. Make images available to the k3d cluster (choose one)
Option A1 — (recommended for quick local dev) Build & import images directly into k3d so cluster nodes already have them (no external registry required).
- Build the images locally and import them into k3d (pwsh):
  ```powershell
  # from repo root
  docker build -t productsvc:latest .\services\productsvc
  docker build -t ordersvc:latest .\services\ordersvc
  docker build -t frontend:latest .\frontend

  # Import images into the existing k3d cluster (replace <clusterName> if not default)
  # This avoids needing an external registry; k3d will make the images available to nodes.
  k3d image import productsvc:latest --cluster k3d-poc
  k3d image import ordersvc:latest --cluster k3d-poc
  k3d image import frontend:latest --cluster k3d-poc
  ```
  - Notes: adjust cluster name (I guessed `k3d-poc` — you can find it with `k3d cluster list`). If `k3d image import` is not available on your k3d version, use `docker save` + `k3d image import` or push to the registry used by cluster.
  - After importing, update the chart image references (see B) and restart deployments so they use the images that exist locally.
Option A2 — Use a registry reachable from the cluster
- Ensure a registry service exists at the hostnames used in charts (either `localhost:5000` or `registry.infra.svc.cluster.local`) and push images there. Example:
  - Create/ensure k3d registry and map it into cluster, then tag & push:
  ```powershell
  # create registry if missing
  k3d registry create registry.infra --port 5000

  # tag and push
  docker tag productsvc:latest registry.infra:5000/productsvc:latest
  docker push registry.infra:5000/productsvc:latest
  ```
  - Use whatever registry host/path your Helm charts reference (or change the charts to match the registry you created). If you use `registry.infra.svc.cluster.local`, you must create a Kubernetes Service/DNS entry with that name (either via Helm/registry chart or a Service in that namespace) so pods can resolve it.

Option A3 — If you prefer to push to Docker Hub / remote registry:
- Tag and push images to a registry accessible from the cluster and change chart `image.repository` to the pushed repository. This is similar to A2 but with public/private remote registry.

Which A option you use depends on whether you want a local quick fix (A1) or a more structured registry setup (A2/A3).

### B. Fix `productsvc` image mismatch (and ensure ordersvc/frontend point to the right repos)
You can override the deployed image directly with Helm for each release. This is safe and immediate.

- Fix `productsvc` release so it uses the productsvc image (example):
  ```powershell
  helm upgrade productsvc infra/helm/productsvc `
    -n app `
    --reuse-values `
    --set image.repository=registry.infra.svc.cluster.local/productsvc `
    --set image.tag=latest
  ```
  Or, if you want to explicitly set to localhost:5000 images (if you loaded them into k3d under that name), e.g.:
  ```powershell
  helm upgrade productsvc infra/helm/productsvc -n app --reuse-values `
    --set image.repository=localhost:5000/productsvc --set image.tag=latest
  ```

- Fix `ordersvc` and frontend similarly if needed:
  ```powershell
  helm upgrade ordersvc infra/helm/ordersvc -n app --reuse-values `
    --set image.repository=registry.infra.svc.cluster.local/ordersvc --set image.tag=latest

  helm upgrade frontend infra/helm/frontend -n app --reuse-values `
    --set image.repository=registry.infra.svc.cluster.local/frontend --set image.tag=latest
  ```
  (Replace repository with the registry path actually reachable by the cluster, e.g., `localhost:5000/...` if you loaded/pushed images there.)

Notes:
- You saw `helm get values productsvc -n app` returned `null`. That means no user-supplied values on that release; the wrong image likely came from an earlier command that set the image or from running `helm upgrade` with an explicit `--set` or different chart. Overriding with `--set` above will force the right image.
- If you prefer editing the chart source, update values.yaml to the desired repo and re-run `helm upgrade productsvc ...`. But I recommend using `--set` for a fast test/rollback.

### C. Redeploy & validate (commands)
After either making images available (A) and/or fixing image references (B), run:
```powershell
# restart rollout so new images are used
kubectl rollout restart deployment/productsvc -n app
kubectl rollout restart deployment/ordersvc -n app
kubectl rollout restart deployment/frontend -n app

# watch rollout status
kubectl rollout status deployment/productsvc -n app
kubectl rollout status deployment/ordersvc -n app
kubectl rollout status deployment/frontend -n app

# check pods and logs
kubectl get pods -n app -o wide
kubectl describe pod -n app <pod-name>
kubectl logs -n app <pod-name> -c <container-name>
```

## Quick validation checklist (what to expect)
- `kubectl get pods -n app` should move from ImagePullBackOff -> Running for each pod.
- `kubectl logs -n app <pod>` should show startup logs from the service binary (not complaints about missing binary).
- `kubectl describe pod` should show successful `Pulling` -> `Pulled` -> `Created` -> `Started`.

## Small debugging hints / diagnostics you can run now
- Show what each release currently references (manifest + values):
  ```powershell
  helm get values productsvc -n app
  helm get manifest productsvc -n app | Select-String -Pattern "image:"
  helm get manifest ordersvc -n app | Select-String -Pattern "image:"
  helm get manifest frontend -n app | Select-String -Pattern "image:"
  ```
- Check whether the cluster knows a registry service:
  ```powershell
  kubectl get svc --all-namespaces | Select-String 'registry' -SimpleMatch
  kubectl get endpoints -n infra
  ```
- Test DNS resolution from a pod (if you have a troubleshooting pod):
  ```powershell
  kubectl run -it --rm busybox --image=busybox --restart=Never -- nslookup registry.infra.svc.cluster.local
  ```

## Risks and edge cases
- If the registry uses TLS and a custom CA, you’ll need imagePullSecrets or the CA installed in nodes.
- Using `localhost:5000` inside pods usually doesn't point to the host machine; prefer k3d-specific registries or import images into nodes.
- If `productsvc` was accidentally installed using the frontend chart or the wrong chart values were passed, we should examine the helm command history. I can search your shell history if you want.

## Next steps — pick one and I’ll execute
1. I can run the Helm override commands now to set the correct `image.repository` for `productsvc`/`ordersvc`/frontend (fast test).
2. I can show you step-by-step pwsh commands to build and import the three images into your k3d cluster (no registry needed).
3. I can prepare a small patch to change values.yaml permanently and run `helm upgrade` (safer for long term).
4. If you'd rather, tell me which images live in what registry (e.g., local daemon vs remote) and I’ll craft exact commands to load/push them and re-deploy.

Tell me which of the above you want me to do now (1–3), and I’ll run the commands and then validate the cluster state.
